## Workflow
**#1** Display a list of music albums using `Vue`, `axios` and an `API endpoint` of [Boolean Careers](https://www.boolean.careers).  
Every album is an object with different properties: `poster`, `author`, `title`, `genre` , and `year`.  
**#2** Use a `select` to filter the albums by genre.   
**#3** Sort albums by year of release.
